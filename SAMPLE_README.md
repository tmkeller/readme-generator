## Description
A set of drivers for your kitty's cybernetic attachments to make your kitty run faster, jump higher, and snuggle more effectively.

## Installation
Simply drag and drop these files into your kitty's solid state hard drive. The drivers will install automatically depending on the cybernetic equipment your kitty has installed.

## Usage
These drivers should interface naturally with your kitty's limbs, although some calibration is sometimes necessary. If your kitty has experience with cybernetic attachments, it should be no problem.

## Contributing
Fork me on github! Excellent additions will be considered for branch merges!

## Tests
Obtain your kitty's consent through your meow translation device, then press and hold the red "test" button for 3 seconds. Your kitty should go through the full range-of-motion and myomer calibration sequence.
